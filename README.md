Space Gold Rush Game ðŸŽ®

A fun game that Player 1 will control their player using the WASD keys, and Player 2 has to use the IJKL keys.
A player may not move to a position on a board that has a wall or other player,
but they must get 10 points each time they move to a position with a coin on it. In this case the coin disappears from the board.
The game has a time limit of half a minute per turn with the player with the highest number of points being the winner.

A game whose whole logic is based on a two-dimensional array (matrix) and HTML / CSS to make the game a game in a browser.
I also used NodeJS to upload the game to the server.
